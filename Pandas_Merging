## Import required package/s
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

## Import datasets
cars1 = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/master/05_Merge/Auto_MPG/cars1.csv")
cars2 = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/master/05_Merge/Auto_MPG/cars2.csv")
print(cars1.head())

## Fix cars1 to get rid of additional unnamed NaN columns
cars1 = cars1.loc[:, "mpg":"car"]
cars1.head()

## No of observations in each dataset
print(cars1.shape)
print(cars2.shape)

## Join cars1/2 into a single dataframe called cars
cars= cars1.append(cars2)
cars

## Create column called owners, with random number series from 10,000 to 100,000
nr_owners = np.random.randint(10,000, high=100001, size = 398, dtype='l')
nr_owners

# Add this column to the database
cars['owners'] = nr_owners
cars.tail()
